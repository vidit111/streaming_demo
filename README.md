ðŸš€ Overcoming Azure Free Tier Limits for Real-Time Data Streaming!
Building a real-time data stream processing pipeline on Azure Free Tier comes with challenges, but as a Data Engineer, adaptability is key! Hereâ€™s how I improvised and replaced missing services to make it work:
![Book Cover](main/project_overview.png)
ðŸ”¹ Data Ingestion: Created an Azure Event Hub & Namespace for streaming data ingestion. However, the Free Tier doesnâ€™t support the "Generate Data" feature, so I built an external Python script that used the Event Hub shared key and the random library to generate & send real-time weather data.

ðŸ”¹ Databricks Setup: Due to no Unity Catalog in Free Tier, I couldnâ€™t create temp schemas for data processing. Instead, I used Hive Metastore and created three databases (bronze, silver, gold) to store and process streaming data.

ðŸ”¹ 3-Layer Data Processing Architecture:
âœ” Bronze Layer â€“ Receives raw streaming data, previews it, and writes to bronze.weather.
âœ” Silver Layer â€“ Parses the event body into JSON, typecasts fields, and writes clean data to silver.weather.
âœ” Gold Layer â€“ Uses watermarking & windowing to compute 50-second rolling averages (temperature, humidity, precipitation).

ðŸ”¹ Visualization Challenge & Workaround:

The Free Tier does not allow direct Power BI integration with Databricks.
Solution: Wrote Silver Layer data to Azure SQL Server, then connected Power BI via DirectQuery.
Issue: Power BI refreshes data every 5 minutes, but new messages arrived every 10 seconds. Manual refresh was needed to see real-time updates.
ðŸ’¡ Takeaway: Constraints fuel innovation! Even with Azure Free Tier limitations, I was able to build, test, and optimize a real-time streaming pipeline using Azure Event Hubs, Databricks, and Power BI.

Would love to connect with professionals working on real-time data processing & cloud engineering! ðŸš€
