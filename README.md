ðŸš€ Overcoming Azure Free Tier Limits for Real-Time Data Streaming!
Building a real-time data streaming pipeline on Azure Free Tier came with challenges, but I improvised to make it work! Hereâ€™s how:

ðŸ”¹ Data Ingestion:
âœ” Created Azure Event Hub & Namespace for streaming data.
âœ” Free Tier doesnâ€™t support "Generate Data", so I:

Built an external Python script to generate random weather data.
Sent data to Event Hub using Shared Key authentication.
ðŸ”¹ Databricks Setup:
âœ” No Unity Catalog in Free Tier â†’ Couldnâ€™t create temp schemas.
âœ” Workaround: Used Hive Metastore and created:

Bronze Layer â†’ Stores raw streaming data (bronze.weather).
Silver Layer â†’ Cleans & transforms data (silver.weather).
Gold Layer â†’ Computes 50-second rolling averages (gold.weather).
ðŸ”¹ Processing & Visualization Challenges:
âœ” Power BI does not support Databricks Free Tier â†’ No direct integration.
âœ” Solution: Wrote Silver Layer data to Azure SQL Server, then connected Power BI via DirectQuery.
âœ” Issue: Power BI refreshes every 5 minutes, but data arrived every 10 seconds â†’ Manual refresh needed to see updates.

ðŸ’¡ Key Takeaway:
Even with Azure Free Tier limitations, I built a fully functional real-time streaming pipeline using Azure Event Hubs, Databricks, and Power BI.

Would love to connect with professionals working on real-time data processing & cloud engineering! ðŸš€
